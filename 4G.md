# 4G

## What is 4G (fourth-generation wireless)?

The 4G wireless cellular standard was defined by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and specifies the key characteristics of the standard, including transmission technology and data speeds.

Each generation of wireless cellular technology has introduced increased bandwidth speeds and network capacity.

4G users get speeds of up to 100 Mbps, while 3G only promised a peak speed of 14 Mbps.

With 4G download speeds, wireless users can stream high-definition video and audio. 4G also enables wireless broadband, which provides a way for users to get internet connectivity without the need for a fixed, wired connection from an internet service provider (ISP).

## Types of 4G:

A breakdown of these two groups is given below in:

1.  Long-Term Evolution (LTE).
2.  WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access).

> ### LTE(Long-Term Evolution):
>
> Long-Term Evolution, or LTE, is a standard for fast wireless communication that is frequently utilised in 4G connections.\
> In technological terms, it differs from 4G; that is, 4G and 4G LTE are not equivalent.\
> LTE data transmits more quickly and with less delay. Global access to the LTE network is possible for both industrial and consumer applications.\
> The term LTE is only used in marketing contexts because 4G’s stipulated speed and technical requirements were unachievable at the time of its introduction. Therefore Compared to 3G, LTE offers far greater speed and capacity, although it does not imply a certain rate. The speed varies from 20 Mbps to 100 Mbps based on the carrier.

> ### WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access):
>
> One kind of 4G wireless internet is called WiMAX.\
>  It functions similarly to wifi, which allows users to access the internet without using cables. It’s not the same as wifi, though, as wifi can only cover a small area, whereas this technology can cover large areas, like cell phone networks with broadband-like high-speed internet access. A 4G network is a type that includes mobile WiMax, however not all 4G networks are WiMAX.\
>  Over 20 MHz wide channels, WiMAX offers peak data rates of 128 Mbps for downlink and 56 Mbps for uplink.

## How Does 4G Network Works?

In essence, a 4G mobile connection uses radio frequencies to send a signal through an antenna, enabling mobile devices to connect to mobile networks.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multiple input/multiple output (MIMO) technologies underpin 4G’s transmission and reception capabilities. \

In comparison to 3G, 4G delivers higher capacity and bandwidth because of these technologies.

In contrast to 3G, MIMO technology helps reduce network congestion and allows more customers to be served without any bottleneck occurring.

## Features of 4G:

The features of 4G fall firmly into three categories, which are:

- improved speeds.
- reduced latency.
- crystal-clear voice calls.

> ### High Data Rates:
>
> - 4G networks offer download speeds ranging from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps.
>
> - The high data rates enable users to enjoy seamless video streaming, rapid downloads, and smooth browsing.

>
> ### Lower latency:
>
> Download speeds aren't the only thing that has been improved, because 4G also has a better response time than 3G – due to lower ‘latency’. This means that a device connected to a 4G mobile network will get a quicker response to a request than the same device connected to a 3G mobile network.\
> The improved latency times, reduced from 80 milliseconds (3G) to around 45 milliseconds (4G), may not seem that significant on paper. However, they can make a significant difference when playing online games and streaming live video.\
> On 5G, latency is lowered further still, coming in at around 21-26ms, and likely to further decrease as 5G infrastructure improves

> ### Enhanced Connectivity:
>
> - 4G provides robust connectivity, improving coverage and service quality.
> - The technology supports a wide range of applications, from high-definition voice calls to rich multimedia content.

> ### Crystal clear voice calls
>
> Voice over LTE (VoLTE) is similar to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), which use voice apps such as Skype to support voice calls over the internet. Effectively, VoLTE rides on the back of the 4G network and brings crystal clear voice calls and video chat to your 4G mobile phone.\
> Another benefit is that it allows you to call and text when you only have a 4G connection, where previously you wouldn’t have been able to.

## Advantages of 4G

- Users can use a 4G connection without a wired connection or phone line. Rather, it use the same mobile phone’s internet connection for operation.
- Because 4G offers portability, users can access the internet from anywhere, at any time.
- Compared to 3G, the cost of internet services has significantly decreased with 4G. It provides high-speed internet at a lower cost as a result.
- Since everything is hosted online these days, customers need fast internet in order to use cloud services, which is achievable with 4G (and soon to be 5G) connections.

## Disadvantages of 4G

- In accordance with the network signal. Mobile network customers face a serious problem with this, especially in rural locations where signal quality can be poor.
- 4G requires increased battery usage. This is so that transmission and reception can occur at the higher data rate of 4G.

## Challenges and Limitations:

1. Infrastructure Requirements:
   - The rollout of 4G requires substantial infrastructure investment, posing challenges for some regions.
   - Rural and remote areas may face difficulties in accessing 4G networks due to these infrastructure demands.
2. Battery Consumption:
   - 4G networks can be more demanding on device batteries, leading to increased power consumption.
   - Device manufacturers have worked to mitigate this through advancements in battery technology and power management.
3. Security Concerns:
   - 4G networks face security challenges, including potential vulnerabilities to cyber attacks.
   - Network providers and manufacturers must address these concerns through robust security measures.
